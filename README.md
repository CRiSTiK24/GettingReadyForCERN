# GettingReadyForCERN
Just me trying to learn about all these cool technologies like ElasticSearch and others

I finally saw that ELK was already dockerized all together with Docker Compose in another github repo, so I decided to fork it and modify it to input my data. Click [CRiSTiK24/ELK-docker-fork](https://github.com/CRiSTiK24/ELK-docker-fork) 
to check the continuation of this project!
